# hello_world

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

You will need to create your own keys.dart on the lib directory, for your your own strings:
String myMapboxToken = "...";
String myAPIurl = "https://.../api/";
String myAPIBasicAuthentication = "user:pass";

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
